React and Redux, Webpack 2 exercise.


## What is this?

It includes complete, minimal react app.
By complete we mean it has examples for:

- components (both container/views and regular ones)
- routes
- reducers (redux)
- actions (both sync and async),
- SASS (with autoprefixer)<sup>1</sup>
- using assets (in CSS and components)
- imports relative to the app root

## Features

- [x] React
- [x] React router
- [x] Redux
- [x] Redux Thunk
- [x] Redux DevTools (you need to have [browser extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) installed)
- [x] Universal rendering
- [x] Webpack 3 (development and production config)
- [x] Hot Module Replacement
- [x] Immutable reducer data
- [x] Babel - static props, decorators
- [x] SASS with autoprefixing
- [x] Webpack dashboard
- [x] Linting
- [x] Included `es6-promise` and `isomorphic-fetch`
- [x] Preview production build
- [x] File imports relative to the app root
- [x] Git hooks - lint before push

## Setup

```
$ npm install
```

## npm tasks

* `start` - starts client app only in development mode, using webpack dev server
* `client:dev` - same as `start` plus fancy webpack dashboard
* `client:build` - builds client application

## Running in dev mode

```
$ npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000/` from your browser of choice.
Server is visible from the local network as well.

## Build client (production)

Build will be placed in the `build` folder.

```
$ npm run client:build
```

If your app is not running on the server root you should change `publicPath` at two places.

In `webpack.config.js` (ATM line 147):

```
output: {
  path: buildPath,
  publicPath: '/your-app/',
  filename: 'app-[hash].js',
},
```

and in `source/js/routes` (ATM line 9):

```
const publicPath = '/your-app/';
```

Don't forget the trailing slash (`/`). In development visit `http://localhost:3000/your-app/`.

## Running client in preview production mode

This command will start webpack dev server, but with `NODE_ENV` set to `production`.
Everything will be minified and served.
Hot reload will not work, so you need to refresh the page manually after changing the code.

```
npm run client:preview
```

## Universal dev mode

```
npm run universal:dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080/` from your browser of choice.
Server is visible from the local network as well.

## Universal build (production)

```
npm run universal:build
```

copy `package.json` and `build` folder to your production server

install only production dependencies and run server

```
npm install --production

node ./build/server.js
```

## Linting

For linting I'm using [eslint-config-airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb),
but some options are overridden to my personal preferences.

```
$ npm run lint
```
